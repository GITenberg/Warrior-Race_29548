<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> never did discover
whose fault it was. Fannia
pointed out that if Donnaught
had had the brains of an
ox, as well as the build, he would
have remembered to check the
tanks. Donnaught, although twice
as big as him, wasn't quite as fast
with an insult. He intimated,
after a little thought, that Fannia's
nose might have obstructed
his reading of the fuel gauge.</p>

<p>This still left them twenty
light-years from Thetis, with a
cupful of transformer fuel in the
emergency tank.</p>

<p>"All right," Fannia said presently.
"What's done is done. We
can squeeze about three light-years
out of the fuel before we're
back on atomics. Hand me <i>The
Galactic Pilot</i>&mdash;unless you forgot
that, too."</p>

<p>Donnaught dragged the bulky
microfilm volume out of its locker,
and they explored its pages.</p>

<p><i>The Galactic Pilot</i> told them
they were in a sparse, seldom-visited
section of space, which
they already knew. The nearest
planetary system was Hatterfield;
no intelligent life there. Sersus
had a native population, but no
refueling facilities. The same with
Illed, Hung and Porderai.</p>

<p>"Ah-ha!" Fannia said. "Read
that, Donnaught. If you can read,
that is."</p>

<p>"Cascella," Donnaught read,
slowly and clearly, following the
line with a thick forefinger. "Type
M sun. Three planets, intelligent
(AA3C) human-type life on second.
Oxygen-breathers. Non-mechanical.
Religious. Friendly.
Unique social structure, described
in Galactic Survey Report
33877242. Population estimate:
stable at three billion. Basic Cascellan
vocabulary taped under
Cas33b2. Scheduled for resurvey
2375 A.D. Cache of transformer
fuel left, beam coordinate 8741
kgl. Physical descript: Unocc.
flatland."</p>

<p>"Transformer fuel, boy!" Fannia
said gleefully. "I believe we
will get to Thetis, after all." He
punched the new direction on the
ship's tape. "If that fuel's still
there."</p>

<p>"Should we read up on the
unique social structure?" Donnaught
asked, still poring over
<i>The Galactic Pilot</i>.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Fannia said. "Just
step over to the main galactic
base on Earth and buy me a
copy."</p>

<p>"I forgot," Donnaught admitted
slowly.</p>

<p>"Let me see," Fannia said,
dragging out the ship's language
library, "Cascellan, Cascellan ...
Here it is. Be good while I learn
the language." He set the tape
in the hypnophone and switched
it on. "Another useless tongue in
my overstuffed head," he murmured,
and then the hypnophone
took over.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Coming</span> out of transformer
drive with at least a drop of
fuel left, they switched to atomics.
Fannia rode the beam right
across the planet, locating the
slender metal spire of the Galactic
Survey cache. The plain was no
longer unoccupied, however. The
Cascellans had built a city around
the cache, and the spire dominated
the crude wood-and-mud
buildings.</p>

<p>"Hang on," Fannia said, and
brought the ship down on the
outskirts of the city, in a field of
stubble.</p>

<p>"Now look," Fannia said, unfastening
his safety belt. "We're
just here for fuel. No souvenirs,
no side-trips, no fraternizing."</p>

<p>Through the port, they could
see a cloud of dust from the city.
As it came closer, they made out
figures running toward their ship.</p>

<p>"What do you think this unique
social structure is?" Donnaught
asked, pensively checking the
charge in a needler gun.</p>

<p>"I know not and care less,"
Fannia said, struggling into space
armor. "Get dressed."</p>

<p>"The air's breathable."</p>

<p>"Look, pachyderm, for all we
know, these Cascellans think the
proper way to greet visitors is to
chop off their heads and stuff
them with green apples. If Galactic
says unique, it probably
means unique."</p>

<p>"Galactic said they were friendly."</p>

<p>"That means they haven't got
atomic bombs. Come on, get
dressed." Donnaught put down
the needler and struggled into an
oversize suit of space armor. Both
men strapped on needlers, paralyzers,
and a few grenades.</p>

<p>"I don't think we have anything
to worry about," Fannia
said, tightening the last nut on his
helmet. "Even if they get rough,
they can't crack space armor.
And if they're not rough, we
won't have any trouble. Maybe
these gewgaws will help." He
picked up a box of trading articles&mdash;mirrors,
toys and the like.</p>

<p>Helmeted and armored, Fannia
slid out the port and raised one
hand to the Cascellans. The language,
hypnotically placed in his
mind, leaped to his lips.</p>

<p>"We come as friends and brothers.
Take us to the chief."</p>

<p>The natives clustered around,
gaping at the ship and the space
armor. Although they had the
same number of eyes, ears and
limbs as humans, they completely
missed looking like them.</p>

<p>"If they're friendly," Donnaught
asked, climbing out of
the port, "why all the hardware?"
The Cascellans were dressed predominantly
in a collection of
knives, swords and daggers. Each
man had at least five, and some
had eight or nine.</p>

<p>"Maybe Galactic got their signals
crossed," Fannia said, as the
natives spread out in an escort.
"Or maybe the natives just use
the knives for mumblypeg."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> city was typical of a non-mechanical
culture. Narrow,
packed-dirt streets twisted between
ramshackle huts. A few
two-story buildings threatened to
collapse at any minute. A stench
filled the air, so strong that Fannia's
filter couldn't quite eradicate
it. The Cascellans bounded
ahead of the heavily laden Earthmen,
dashing around like a pack
of playful puppies. Their knives
glittered and clanked.</p>

<p>The chief's house was the only
three-story building in the city.
The tall spire of the cache was
right behind it.</p>

<p>"If you come in peace," the
chief said when they entered,
"you are welcome." He was a
middle-aged Cascellan with at
least fifteen knives strapped to
various parts of his person. He
squatted cross-legged on a raised
dais.</p>

<p>"We are privileged," Fannia
said. He remembered from the
hypnotic language lesson that
"chief" on Cascella meant more
than it usually did on Earth. The
chief here was a combination of
king, high priest, deity and bravest
warrior.</p>

<p>"We have a few simple gifts
here," Fannia added, placing the
gewgaws at the king's feet. "Will
his majesty accept?"</p>

<p>"No," the king said. "We accept
no gifts." Was that the
unique social structure? Fannia
wondered. It certainly was not
human. "We are a warrior race.
What we want, we take."</p>

<p>Fannia sat cross-legged in
front of the dais and exchanged
conversation with the king while
Donnaught played with the
spurned toys. Trying to overcome
the initial bad impression, Fannia
told the chief about the stars
and other worlds, since simple
people usually liked fables. He
spoke of the ship, not mentioning
yet that it was out of fuel. He
spoke of Cascella, telling the
chief how its fame was known
throughout the Galaxy.</p>

<p>"That is as it should be," the
chief said proudly. "We are a
race of warriors, the like of which
has never been seen. Every man
of us dies fighting."</p>

<p>"You must have fought some
great wars," Fannia said politely,
wondering what idiot had written
up the galactic report.</p>

<p>"I have not fought a war for
many years," the chief said. "We
are united now, and all our enemies
have joined us."</p>

<p>Bit by bit, Fannia led up to
the matter of the fuel.</p>

<p>"What is this 'fuel'?" the chief
asked, haltingly because there
was no equivalent for it in the
Cascellan language.</p>

<p>"It makes our ship go."</p>

<p>"And where is it?"</p>

<p>"In the metal spire," Fannia
said. "If you would just allow
us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the holy shrine?" the chief
exclaimed, shocked. "The tall
metal church which the gods left
here long ago?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Fannia said sadly,
knowing what was coming. "I
guess that's it."</p>

<p>"It is sacrilege for an outworlder
to go near it," the chief said.
"I forbid it."</p>

<p>"We need the fuel." Fannia
was getting tired of sitting cross-legged.
Space armor wasn't built
for complicated postures. "The
spire was put here for such
emergencies."</p>

<p>"Strangers, know that I am god
of my people, as well as their
leader. If you dare approach
the sacred temple, there will be
war."</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that," Fannia
said, getting to his feet.</p>

<p>"And since we are a race of
warriors," the chief said, "at my
command, every fighting man of
the planet will move against you.
More will come from the hills
and from across the rivers."</p>

<p>Abruptly, the chief drew a
knife. It must have been a signal,
because every native in the room
did the same.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Fannia</span> dragged Donnaught
away from the toys. "Look,
lummox. These friendly warriors
can't do a damn thing to us.
Those knives can't cut space
armor, and I doubt if they have
anything better. Don't let them
pile up on you, though. Use the
paralyzer first, the needler if they
really get thick."</p>

<p>"Right." Donnaught whisked
out and primed a paralyzer in a
single coordinated movement.
With weapons, Donnaught was
fast and reliable, which was virtue
enough for Fannia to keep him
as a partner.</p>

<p>"We'll cut around this building
and grab the fuel. Two cans
ought to be enough. Then we'll
beat it fast."</p>

<p>They walked out the building,
followed by the Cascellans. Four
carriers lifted the chief, who was
barking orders. The narrow
street outside was suddenly
jammed with armed natives. No
one tried to touch them yet, but
at least a thousand knives were
flashing in the sun.</p>

<p>In front of the cache was a
solid phalanx of Cascellans. They
stood behind a network of ropes
that probably marked the boundary
between sacred and profane
ground.</p>

<p>"Get set for it," Fannia said,
and stepped over the ropes.</p>

<p>Immediately the foremost temple
guard raised his knife. Fannia
brought up the paralyzer, not
firing it yet, still moving forward.</p>

<p>The foremost native shouted
something, and the knife swept
across in a glittering arc. The
Cascellan gurgled something else,
staggered and fell. Bright blood
oozed from his throat.</p>

<p>"I <i>told</i> you not to use the
needler yet!" Fannia said.</p>

<p>"I didn't," Donnaught protested.
Glancing back, Fannia saw
that Donnaught's needler was
still holstered.</p>

<p>"Then I don't get it," said
Fannia bewilderedly.</p>

<p>Three more natives bounded
forward, their knives held high.
They tumbled to the ground also.
Fannia stopped and watched as a
platoon of natives advanced on
them.</p>

<p>Once they were within stabbing
range of the Earthmen, the natives
were slitting their own
throats!</p>

<p>Fannia was frozen for a moment,
unable to believe his eyes.
Donnaught halted behind him.</p>

<p>Natives were rushing forward
by the hundreds now, their knives
poised, screaming at the Earthmen. As
they came within range,
each native stabbed himself, tumbling
on a quickly growing pile
of bodies. In minutes the Earthmen
were surrounded by a heap
of bleeding Cascellan flesh, which
was steadily growing higher.</p>

<p>"All right!" Fannia shouted.
"Stop it." He yanked Donnaught
back with him, to profane ground.
"Truce!" he yelled in Cascellan.</p>

<p>The crowd parted and the chief
was carried through. With two
knives clenched in his fists, he
was panting from excitement.</p>

<p>"We have won the first battle!"
he said proudly. "The might of
our warriors frightens even such
aliens as yourselves. You shall
not profane our temple while a
man is alive on Cascella!"</p>

<p>The natives shouted their approval
and triumph.</p>

<p>The two aliens dazedly stumbled
back to their ship.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"So</span> that's what Galactic
meant by 'a unique social
structure,'" Fannia said morosely.
He stripped off his armor and
lay down on his bunk. "Their
way of making war is to suicide
their enemies into capitulation."</p>

<p>"They must be nuts," Donnaught
grumbled. "That's no way
to fight."</p>

<p>"It works, doesn't it?" Fannia
got up and stared out a porthole.
The sun was setting, painting
the city a charming red in
its glow. The beams of light
glistened off the spire of the
Galactic cache. Through the open
doorway they could hear the
boom and rattle of drums. "Tribal
call to arms," Fannia said.</p>

<p>"I still say it's crazy." Donnaught
had some definite ideas
on fighting. "It ain't human."</p>

<p>"I'll buy that. The idea seems
to be that if enough people
slaughter themselves, the enemy
gives up out of sheer guilty
conscience."</p>

<p>"What if the enemy doesn't
give up?"</p>

<p>"Before these people united,
they must have fought it out
tribe to tribe, suiciding until
someone gave up. The losers
probably joined the victors; the
tribe must have grown until it
could take over the planet by
sheer weight of numbers." Fannia
looked carefully at Donnaught,
trying to see if he understood.
"It's anti-survival, of
course; if someone didn't give up,
the race would probably kill
themselves." He shook his head.
"But war of any kind is anti-survival.
Perhaps they've got
rules."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we just barge in and
grab the fuel quick?" Donnaught
asked. "And get out before they
all killed themselves?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Fannia said.
"They might go on committing
suicide for the next ten years,
figuring they were still fighting
us." He looked thoughtfully at
the city. "It's that chief of theirs.
He's their god and he'd probably
keep them suiciding until he was
the only man left. Then he'd grin,
say, 'We are great warriors,' and
kill himself."</p>

<p>Donnaught shrugged his big
shoulders in disgust. "Why don't
we knock him off?"</p>

<p>"They'd just elect another
god." The sun was almost below
the horizon now. "I've got an
idea, though," Fannia said. He
scratched his head. "It might
work. All we can do is try."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">At</span> midnight, the two men
sneaked out of the ship, moving
silently into the city. They
were both dressed in space armor
again. Donnaught carried two
empty fuel cans. Fannia had
his paralyzer out.</p>

<p>The streets were dark and silent
as they slid along walls and
around posts, keeping out of
sight. A native turned a corner
suddenly, but Fannia paralyzed
him before he could make a
sound.</p>

<p>They crouched in the darkness,
in the mouth of an alley facing
the cache.</p>

<p>"Have you got it straight?"
Fannia asked. "I paralyze the
guards. You bolt in and fill up
those cans. We get the hell out
of here, quick. When they check,
they find the cans still there.
Maybe they won't commit suicide
then."</p>

<p>The men moved across the
shadowy steps in front of the
cache. There were three Cascellans
guarding the entrance, their
knives stuck in their loincloths.
Fannia stunned them with a medium
charge, and Donnaught
broke into a run.</p>

<p>Torches instantly flared, natives
boiled out of every alleyway,
shouting, waving their
knives.</p>

<p>"We've been ambushed!" Fannia
shouted. "Get back here,
Donnaught!"</p>

<p>Donnaught hurriedly retreated.
The natives had been waiting for
them. Screaming, yowling, they
rushed at the Earthmen, slitting
their own throats at five-foot
range. Bodies tumbled in front
of Fannia, almost tripping him
as he backed up. Donnaught
caught him by an arm and yanked
him straight. They ran out of
the sacred area.</p>

<p>"Truce, damn it!" Fannia called
out. "Let me speak to the chief.
Stop it! Stop it! I want a truce!"</p>

<p>Reluctantly, the Cascellans
stopped their slaughter.</p>

<p>"This is war," the chief said,
striding forward. His almost human
face was stern under the
torchlight. "You have seen our
warriors. You know now that you
cannot stand against them. The
word has spread to all our lands.
My entire people are prepared to
do battle."</p>

<p>He looked proudly at his fellow-Cascellans,
then back to the
Earthmen. "I myself will lead
my people into battle now. There
will be no stopping us. We will
fight until you surrender yourselves
completely, stripping off
your armor."</p>

<p>"Wait, Chief," Fannia panted,
sick at the sight of so much
blood. The clearing was a scene
out of the Inferno. Hundreds of
bodies were sprawled around. The
streets were muddy with blood.</p>

<p>"Let me confer with my partner
tonight. I will speak with you
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"No," the chief said. "You
started the battle. It must go to
its conclusion. Brave men wish
to die in battle. It is our fondest
wish. You are the first enemy we
have had in many years, since
we subdued the mountain tribes."</p>

<p>"Sure," Fannia said. "But let's
talk about it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I myself will fight you," the
chief said, holding up a dagger. "I
will die for my people, as a warrior
must!"</p>

<p>"Hold it!" Fannia shouted.
"Grant us a truce. We are allowed
to fight only by sunlight. It
is a tribal taboo."</p>

<p>The chief thought for a moment,
then said, "Very well. Until
tomorrow."</p>

<p>The beaten Earthmen walked
slowly back to their ship amid
the jeers of the victorious populace.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Next</span> morning, Fannia still
didn't have a plan. He knew
that he had to have fuel; he
wasn't planning on spending the
rest of his life on Cascella, or
waiting until the Galactic Survey
sent another ship, in fifty years
or so. On the other hand, he
hesitated at the idea of being
responsible for the death of anywhere
up to three billion people.
It wouldn't be a very good record
to take to Thetis. The Galactic
Survey might find out about it.
Anyway, he just wouldn't do it.</p>

<p>He was stuck both ways.</p>

<p>Slowly, the two men walked
out to meet the chief. Fannia was
still searching wildly for an idea
while listening to the drums
booming.</p>

<p>"If there was only someone we
could fight," Donnaught mourned,
looking at his useless blasters.</p>

<p>"That's the deal," Fannia said.
"Guilty conscience is making sinners
of us all, or something like
that. They expect us to give in
before the carnage gets out of
hand." He considered for a moment.
"It's not so crazy, actually.
On Earth, armies don't usually
fight until every last man is
slaughtered on one side. Someone
surrenders when they've had
enough."</p>

<p>"If they'd just fight <i>us</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, if they only&mdash;" He
stopped. "We'll fight each other!"
he said. "These people look at
suicide as war. Wouldn't they
look upon war&mdash;real fighting&mdash;as
suicide?"</p>

<p>"What good would that do us?"
Donnaught asked.</p>

<p>They were coming into the city
now and the streets were lined
with armed natives. Around the
city there were thousands more.
Natives were filling the plain, as
far as the eye could see. Evidently
they had responded to the drums
and were here to do battle with
the aliens.</p>

<p>Which meant, of course, a
wholesale suicide.</p>

<p>"Look at it this way," Fannia
said. "If a guy plans on suiciding
on Earth, what do we do?"</p>

<p>"Arrest him?" Donnaught asked.</p>

<p>"Not at first. We offer him anything
he wants, if he just won't
do it. People offer the guy money,
a job, their daughters, anything,
just so he won't do it. It's taboo
on Earth."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"So," Fannia went on, "maybe
fighting is just as taboo here.
Maybe they'll offer us fuel, if
we'll just stop."</p>

<p>Donnaught looked dubious, but
Fannia felt it was worth a try.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> pushed their way through
the crowded city, to the entrance
of the cache. The chief was
waiting for them, beaming on
his people like a jovial war god.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to do battle?"
he asked. "Or to surrender?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Fannia said. "Now,
Donnaught!"</p>

<p>He swung, and his mailed fist
caught Donnaught in the ribs.
Donnaught blinked.</p>

<p>"Come on, you idiot, hit me
back."</p>

<p>Donnaught swung, and Fannia
staggered from the force of the
blow. In a second they were at
it like a pair of blacksmiths,
mailed blows ringing from their
armored hides.</p>

<p>"A little lighter," Fannia gasped,
picking himself up from the
ground. "You're denting my ribs."
He belted Donnaught viciously
on the helmet.</p>

<p>"Stop it!" the chief cried. "This
is disgusting!"</p>

<p>"It's working," Fannia panted.
"Now let me strangle you. I think
that might do it."</p>

<p>Donnaught obliged by falling
to the ground. Fannia clamped
both hands around Donnaught's
armored neck, and squeezed.</p>

<p>"Make believe you're in agony,
idiot," he said.</p>

<p>Donnaught groaned and moaned
as convincingly as he could.</p>

<p>"You must stop!" the chief
screamed. "It is terrible to kill
another!"</p>

<p>"Then let me get some fuel,"
Fannia said, tightening his grip
on Donnaught's throat.</p>

<p>The chief thought it over for
a little while. Then he shook his
head.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You are aliens. If you want to
do this disgraceful thing, do it.
But you shall not profane our
religious relics."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Donnaught</span> and Fannia
staggered to their feet. Fannia
was exhausted from fighting
in the heavy space armor; he
barely made it up.</p>

<p>"Now," the chief said, "surrender
at once. Take off your
armor or do battle with us."</p>

<p>The thousands of warriors&mdash;possibly
millions, because more
were arriving every second&mdash;shouted
their blood-wrath. The
cry was taken up on the outskirts
and echoed to the hills,
where more fighting men were
pouring down into the crowded
plain.</p>

<p>Fannia's face contorted. He
couldn't give himself and Donnaught
up to the Cascellans. They
might be cooked at the next
church supper. For a moment he
considered going after the fuel
and letting the damned fools
suicide all they pleased.</p>

<p>His mind an angry blank, Fannia
staggered forward and hit the
chief in the face with a mailed
glove.</p>

<p>The chief went down, and the
natives backed away in horror.
Quickly, the chief snapped out a
knife and brought it up to his
throat. Fannia's hands closed on
the chief's wrists.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," Fannia croaked.
"We're going to take that fuel.
If any man makes a move&mdash;if
anyone kills himself&mdash;I'll kill
your chief."</p>

<p>The natives milled around uncertainly.
The chief was struggling
wildly in Fannia's hands,
trying to get a knife to his throat,
so he could die honorably.</p>

<p>"Get it," Fannia told Donnaught,
"and hurry it up."</p>

<p>The natives were uncertain just
what to do. They had their knives
poised at their throats, ready to
plunge if battle was joined.</p>

<p>"Don't do it," Fannia warned.
"I'll kill the chief and then he'll
never die a warrior's death."</p>

<p>The chief was still trying to
kill himself. Desperately, Fannia
held on, knowing he had to keep
him from suicide in order to hold
the threat of death over him.</p>

<p>"Listen, Chief," Fannia said,
eying the uncertain crowd. "I
must have your promise there'll
be no more war between us. Either
I get it or I kill you."</p>

<p>"Warriors!" the chief roared.
"Choose a new ruler. Forget me
and do battle!"</p>

<p>The Cascellans were still uncertain,
but knives started to lift.</p>

<p>"If you do it," Fannia shouted
in despair, "I'll kill your chief.
<i>I'll kill all of you!</i>"</p>

<p>That stopped them.</p>

<p>"I have powerful magic in my
ship. I can kill every last man,
and then you won't be able to
die a warrior's death. <i>Or</i> get to
heaven!"</p>

<p>The chief tried to free himself
with a mighty surge that almost
tore one of his arms free, but
Fannia held on, pinning both
arms behind his back.</p>

<p>"Very well," the chief said,
tears springing into his eyes. "A
warrior must die by his own hand.
You have won, alien."</p>

<p>The crowd shouted curses as
the Earthmen carried the chief
and the cans of fuel back to the
ship. They waved their knives
and danced up and down in a
frenzy of hate.</p>

<p>"Let's make it fast," Fannia
said, after Donnaught had fueled
the ship.</p>

<p>He gave the chief a push and
leaped in. In a second they were
in the air, heading for Thetis and
the nearest bar at top speed.</p>

<p>The natives were hot for blood&mdash;their
own. Every man of them
pledged his life to wiping out the
insult to their leader and god,
and to their shrine.</p>

<p>But the aliens were gone. There
was nobody to fight.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
